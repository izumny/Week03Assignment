After watching the video, Source Control with git, you should have already set up a GitHub account for this program.   

If you have not setup your GitHub account, review the above video in the Week 3: Weekly Videos and Curriculum and set your account up before proceeding with this assignment. 

Instructions:  

Create a new repository on GitHub for this week’s assignments and push this document, and any files that you have created to the repository. 

Include the URLs for this week’s repository and video where instructed. 

Submit this document as a .PDF file in the LMS. 

Assignment Steps: 

The link below has a zipped file that contains an empty directory (folder) for your assignments.  

Download the file to your computer and unzip it.  

This directory (folder) should be used to organize each week’s projects in the course.

Note:  In the following Git/GitHub Tutorial, a file is created in Terminal (on a Mac) using touch filename   

           To do the same thing in Command Prompt (on Windows), use the following command: 

                                        (Windows or Mac) echo “text-to-put-into-file” > filename  

 

Following the Git/GitHub tutorial in your week 0 video: 

Create a directory (folder) inside Week 03 directory 

Create a repository on the GitHub website. 

Push your directory of files to GitHub as instructed in the video. 

After your first push, please ensure that you make some changes to your directory (folder), such as adding a new file or changing your code.  

Push those changes to your repository a second time (as shown in the video).

When complete, paste a screenshot of your terminal or command prompt that shows the commands above completed. 

 
Video Steps: 

Create a video, up to five minutes max, showing and explaining exactly what you did for this assignment Git/GitHub. 

This video should be done using screen share and voice over.  

This can easily be done using Zoom, although you don't have to use Zoom, it's just what we recommend.  

You can create a new meeting, start screen sharing, and start recording.  

This will create a video recording on your computer.  

This should then be uploaded to a publicly accessible site, such as YouTube.  

Ensure the link you share is PUBLIC or UNLISTED! 

If it is not accessible by your grader, your project will be graded based on what they can access.
